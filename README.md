ðŸŒŸ Predicting Customer Purchases with Decision Tree Classifier! ðŸŒŸ

I'm excited to share the results of my latest project during my internship, where I used the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict customer purchase behavior. Here's a glimpse into my journey and key takeaways:

Project Overview:
Using demographic and behavioral data, I built a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service. This involved working with a rich dataset containing over 41,000 observations and 21 attributes, including age, job, marital status, education, and financial information.

Data Preprocessing:
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values by dropping incomplete rows.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Applied one-hot encoding to convert categorical data into a numeric format.
Splitting Data: Divided the dataset into an 80-20 training and testing split to ensure robust model evaluation.

Model Building:
Model Training: Trained the Decision Tree Classifier on the training data.
Model Testing: Evaluated the model's performance on the test data, achieving an impressive accuracy of 87%.

Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: The model correctly predicted the subscription status for 87% of test instances.
Confusion Matrix & Classification Report: Provided insights into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, highlighting the model's precision and recall for both subscribed ('yes') and non-subscribed ('no') customers.

Visualizations:
Decision Tree Structure: Illustrated the decision-making process of the model.
Confusion Matrix Heatmap: Visualized true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Feature Importance: Highlighted the top 10 most influential features in predicting customer subscriptions.
Subscription Distribution: Displayed the count of subscribed vs. non-subscribed customers.
Pairplot: Showcased relationships between numerical features.
Age Distribution by Subscription: Compared age distributions for subscribed and non-subscribed customers.
Boxplot of Age by Subscription: Visualized significant age-related differences.
Correlation Heatmap: Identified strong relationships between numerical features.
Violin Plot of Categorical Variables: Showed distribution within each category by subscription status.
Feature Distribution: Histograms for all features across the dataset.
Bar Plot of Categorical Features: Displayed the frequency of each category.
Boxplots of Numerical Features: Highlighted the spread and outliers.

Key Results:
The decision tree classifier effectively captured patterns related to customer subscriptions, achieving a balanced performance with high interpretability. This model can be further refined and extended to enhance predictive accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion:
This project was an incredible learning experience, blending data science techniques with real-world applications. The decision tree model provided valuable insights into customer behavior, and the visualizations helped in understanding data distribution and feature significance. Moving forward, I aim to experiment with other machine learning models and techniques to improve prediction accuracy and model performance.
